# LatticeGradientFlowCorrection
Accurate numerical estimate of tree-level improvement factor for the gradient-flowed Yang-Mills energy density calculated in "[The lattice gradient flow at tree-level and its improvement](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP09(2014)018)" by Zoltan Fodor, Kieran Holland, Julius Kuti, Santanu Mondal, Daniel Nogradic, and Chik Him Wong. You should cite the latter work if you use this code for your research.
